## Usage

```
Usage: 1. reqflow <command> [<options>] [<args>]
       2. reqflow <config-file>


1. reqflow <command> [<options>] [<args>]

Commands:

    stat [doc ...]  Print the status of requirements in all documents or the
                    given documents. Without additionnal option, only
                    unresolved coverage issues are reported.
         -s         Print a one-line summary for each document.
         -v         Print the status of all requirements.
                    Status codes:

                      'U'  Uncovered

    trac [doc ...]  Print the traceability matrix of the requirements 
                    (A covered by B).
         [-r]       Print the reverse traceability matrix (A covers B).
         [-x <fmt>] Select export format: text (default), csv, html.
                    If format 'html' is chosen, -r is ignored, as both foward
                    and reverse traceability matrices are displayed.

    review          Print the requirements with their text.
         [-f | -r]  Print also traceability (forward or backward)
         [-x <fmt>] Choose format: txt, csv.

    config          Print the list of configured documents.

    debug <file>    Dump text extracted from file (debug purpose).

    regex <pattern> [<text>]
                    Test regex given by <pattern> applied on <text>.
                    If <text> is omitted, then the text is read from stdin.

    version
    help

Options:
    -c <config>  Select configuration file. Defaults to 'conf.req'.
    -o <file>    Output to file instead of stdout.
                 Not supported for commands 'config', debug' and 'regex'.

2. reqflow <config>
This is equivalent to:
    reqflow trac -c <config> -x html -o <outfile> && start <outfile>

Purpose: This usage is suitable for double-cliking on the config file.
Note: <config> must be different from the commands of use case 1.
```

## Sample Configuration File

`conf.req`

```
# document <document-id> -path <document-path> -req <pattern> \
#          [-stop-after <pattern>] [-ref <pattern>] [-start-after <pattern>] \
#          [-nocov]
#
# <pattern> must be a Perl Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE)
# -req indicates how the requirements must be captured
# -ref indicates how the referenced requirements must be captured
# 
# Keyword 'define' may be used to define values:
# 
#   define PATH
#   document x -path PATH/x.txt
#   document y -path PATH/y.txt

document SPEC -path SPEC.docx -req REQ_[-a-zA-Z0-9_]* -stop-after Annex
document TEST -path TEST.txt \
    -req T_[-a-zA-Z0-9_]* \
    -ref "Ref:  *(.*)" \
    -stop-after "Annex" \
    -start-after "Tests cases" \
    -nocov -sort alphanum

# CSS for HTML output (optional)
htmlcss style.css
```

## Configuration Reference

A configuration file contains directives:

- `document`: document to be analysed (at least 1)
- `define`: expression that can be reused within the configuration file (zero or more)
- `htmlcss`: CSS file to be used for HTML output (zero or one)

General syntax:

- Parameters with spaces must be enclosed by quotes. Eg: "Some file.docx"
- Directives can be spanned on several lines ending with backslash (`\`)
- Escape character (for quotes, etc.): backslash (`\`)

### Directive `define`

Define a variable.

Syntax:
```
define NAME PATTERN
```

Example:

    define ALPHANUM [-a-zA-Z0-9_]
    document X -path /path/to/x -req REQ_ALPHANUM

### Directive `document`

Start a document description.

Syntax:
```
document NAME PARAMETERS ...
```

Parameters:

- `-end-req` Indicate the end of the text of a requirement. This is used when you run `reqflow review`. Note that the capture of requirements identifiers takes precedence over this option: a requirement id will automatically put an end to the text of the previous requirement.

- `-nocov` Do not report uncovered requirements (useful for-top level documents).

- `-path` Path to the file.

- `-ref` Pattern for capturing references identifiers (regular expression).

- `-prefix-req` Add this prefix to captured requirements to obtain the final requirements identifiers (useful to avoid conflicts when different documents use the same requirements identifiers)

- `-req` Pattern for capturing requirements identifiers (regular expression).

- `-sort` Sort method when listing requirements: `document` (same order as the are in the document) or `alphanum` (alphanumeric order).

- `-start-after` Start capturing requirements after this pattern (regular expression).

- `-stop-after` Stop capturing requirements after this pattern (regular expression).

- `-type` Type of the document, overriding the file extension. One of: `txt`, `docx`, `odt`, `xml`, `pdf`.

### Directive `htmlcss`

Indicate a CSS file for HTML output (generated with command-line option `-x html`).

Example:

```
htmlcss style.css
```

Generated HTML:

```
<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>
```

[Example of CSS file](stylesheet.css)

If no `htmlcss` is given, a default embedded CSS stylesheet is used.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables can be inserted in the configuration file, using a dollar sign ($) prefix.

Example:

```
document SPEC -path $DOCUMENT -req REQ_[-a-zA-Z0-9_]*
# or
document SPEC -path ${DOCUMENT} -req REQ_[-a-zA-Z0-9_]*
```
