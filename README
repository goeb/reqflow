Overview

Reqflow is a free and open-source tool for tracing requirements across
documents.

To launch Reqflow:

    - double-click it,
    - this will generate an HTML report and open it.

Sample file 'test.req'

    define ALPHANUM [-a-zA-Z0-9_]
    define REQ_PATTERN "REQ_ALPHANUM+"
    define TST_PATTERN "TST_ALPHANUM+"
    define REF_PATTERN "Ref: (ALPHANUM+)"

    document SPEC -path SPEC.pdf -req REQ_PATTERN -stop-after Annex
